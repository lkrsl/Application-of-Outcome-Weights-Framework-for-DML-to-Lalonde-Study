  This book replicates the LaLonde study by Imbens & Xu (2024) and extends it by comparing a
  full with a reduced covariate model to mitigate potential confounding. 
  It evaluates various methods to improve overlap and covariate balance for robust 
  treatment effect estimation and applies the outcome weights framework by Knaus & Pfleiderer (2024) 
  to assess another estimator and analyse the distributional properties of outcome weights.
  The analysis draws on the original LaLonde dataset as well as the LaLonde–Dehejia–Wahba (LDW) and LaLonde–Calónico–Smith (LCS) datasets.

# Preface {-}

This book replicates the LaLonde study by @imbens2024 and extends it by comparing a
full with a reduced covariate model to mitigate potential confounding. 
It evaluates various methods to improve overlap and covariate balance for robust treatment effect estimation and 
applies the outcome weights framework by @OW_Package to assess another estimator and analyse the distributional properties of outcome weights. 
The analysis draws on the original LaLonde dataset as well as the LaLonde–Dehejia–Wahba (LDW) and LaLonde–Calónico–Smith (LCS) datasets.

Section 1 introduces required packages and wrapper functions used throughout the analysis. 
Section 2 replicates and extends the full covariate model from @imbens2024 using the LaLonde-Dehejia-Wahba (LDW) dataset. 
Section 3 applies a reduced covariate set to the same LDW dataset. 
Section 4 analyzes the original LaLonde dataset following similar methods and 
section 5 explores the LaLonde-Calónico-Smith (LCS) dataset, focusing on female samples.
