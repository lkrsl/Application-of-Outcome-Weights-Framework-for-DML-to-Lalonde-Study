  This book replicates the LaLonde study by Imbens & Xu (2024) and extends it by comparing a
  full with a reduced covariate model to assess potential confounding. 
  It evaluates various methods to improve overlap and covariate balance for robust 
  treatment effect estimation and applies the outcome weights framework by Knaus & Pfleiderer (2024) 
  to assess another estimator, while analysing the distributional properties of resulting outcome weights.
  It further applies placebo tests and sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the treatment effect estimates.
  The analysis draws on the original LaLonde data (NSW) as well as the LaLonde–Dehejia–Wahba (LDW) and 
  LaLonde–Calónico–Smith (LCS) data.

# Preface {-}

This book replicates the LaLonde study by @imbens2024 and extends it by comparing a
full with a reduced covariate model to assess potential confounding.
It evaluates various methods to improve overlap and covariate balance for robust treatment effect estimation and 
applies the outcome weights framework by @OW_Package to assess another estimator, while analysing the distributional properties of resulting outcome weights.
It further applies placebo tests and sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the treatment effect estimates. 
The analysis draws on the original LaLonde data (NSW) as well as the LaLonde–Dehejia–Wahba (LDW) and LaLonde–Calónico–Smith (LCS) data.

Section 1 introduces required packages and wrapper functions used throughout the analysis. 
Section 2 replicates and extends the full covariate model from @imbens2024 using the LDW sample. 
Section 3 applies a reduced covariate set to the same LDW sample. 
Section 4 analyzes the NSW sample following similar methods and 
section 5 explores the LCS sample, focusing on female samples.
