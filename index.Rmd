# Preface {-}

This book replicates the LaLonde study as revisited by @imbens2024, comparing full 
and reduced covariate models to reduce potential confounding. 
It evaluates various methods to improve overlap and covariate balance for more robust 
treatment effect estimation and applies the outcome weights framework by @OW_Package 
to LaLonde data variants as well as analyzes the distributional properties of outcome weights.

Section 1 introduces required packages and wrapper functions used throughout the analysis. 
Section 2 replicates and extends the full covariate model from @imbens2024 
using the LaLonde-Dehejia-Wahba (LDW) dataset. 
Section 3 applies a reduced covariate set to the same LDW data. 
Section 4 analyzes the original LaLonde dataset following similar methods and 
section 5 explores the LaLonde-Cal√≥nico-Smith (LCS) dataset, focusing on female samples.
